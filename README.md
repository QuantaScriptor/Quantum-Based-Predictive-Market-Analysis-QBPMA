# Quantum-Based Predictive Market Analysis (QBPMA)

## Description
Quantum-Based Predictive Market Analysis (QBPMA) is a quantum algorithm designed to analyze and predict market trends with higher accuracy using quantum computing principles.

## Potential Value
$1,000,000+

## Mathematical Equations
1. **Feature Extraction**: Percentage change calculation
   $$
   \text{pct\_change} = \frac{X_t - X_{t-1}}{X_{t-1}}
   $$
2. **Quantum Circuit Initialization**: Creating superposition states
   $$
   \left| \psi \right\rangle = H \left| 0 \right\rangle^n
   $$
3. **Measurement**: Collapsing quantum state
   $$
   M(\left| \psi \right\rangle) = \left| x \right\rangle \text{ with probability } |\left\langle x | \psi \right\rangle|^2
   $$

## Installation
To use QBPMA, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `qiskit`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas qiskit scikit-learn
